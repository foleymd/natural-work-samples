# work-samples

This repository contains Natural/ADABAS code samples. The original code has been modified to obscure the data sources. 

While ADABAS can be used as a relational database, it is a non-relational database in the context of this work. Natural is a mainframe programming language used in conjunction with ADABAS. ADABAS is known for high transactional throughput, and it is used primarily in banking and government.
